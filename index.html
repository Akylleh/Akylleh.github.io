<h1> Welcome to NASA and the Mars Pathfinder Mission! </h1>
<p> This is a substitute for the usual NASA Home Page. In an effort to help the millions trying to get information on Mars Pathfinder, we've put this list of reflector sites on our top-level page. Once you get to a site, <b>bookmark that page</b> so you will not have to come back here. Information on other projects is still available from the <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/19970711094601/http://www.nasa.gov/>Shuttle</a> Web, <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/19970711094601/http://www.nasa.gov/>Shuttle-Mir</a> Web and <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/19970711094601/http://www.nasa.gov/>today@nasa.gov</a>, as well as the regular <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/19970711094601/http://www.nasa.gov/>NASA Home Page</a>. This page will remain up for the next several days; once net traffic subsides, the regular Home Page will be reposted to the www.nasa.gov URL.</p>
